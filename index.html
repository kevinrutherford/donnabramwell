      <h2>
        EXPLORING THE ROLE OF EMPLOYERS AND MANAGERS </br>
        IN SUPPORTING PEOPLE WITH LONG-TERM CONDITIONS </br>
        IN THE WORKPLACE
      </h2>

      <p>
      I would be grateful if you would consider helping me with my research project on
      people's experience of long-term illness (or long-term conditions) at work. I am a
      PhD student in the <strong>Health Sciences Group - Primary Care</strong>
      at the
      <strong>University of Manchester</strong>, carrying out this research for my thesis.
      </p>

      <p>
      The number of people living with a long-term condition is set to rise in the coming years,
      which will mean that more people with long-term illness will be employed in the
      labour market.   In light of this, we are interested in exploring your experiences,
      views and opinions about supporting those with long-term conditions in the
      workplace.  Currently there is little research in this area and this study provides an
      opportunity for employers and/or line managers to air their views.
