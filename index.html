      INVITATION TO TAKE PART IN RESEARCH
      </p>

      <p>
      I would be grateful if you would consider helping me with my research project on
      peopleâ€™s experience of long-term illness (or long-term conditions) at work. I am a
      PhD student in Health Sciences Group - Primary Care at the University of
      Manchester, carrying out this research for my thesis.
      </p>

      <p>
      The number of people living with a long-term condition is set to rise in coming years
      which will mean that more people with long-term illness will be employed in the
      labour market.   In light of this, we are interested in exploring your experiences,
      views and opinions about supporting those with long-term conditions in the
      workplace.  Currently there is little research in this area and this study provides an
      opportunity for employers/and or line managers to air their views.
      I have enclosed an Information Sheet which explains more about this project and
      what your involvement in the research would be so that you can decide whether or
      not you wish you to participate. If you would like to take part in this research and
      help us to understand your views of supporting long-term conditions in the
      workplace then please contact Donna Bramwell at the University of Manchester by
      phone 0161 306 7046 or email at donna.bramwell@postgrad.manchester.ac.uk.
      Thank you very much for reading this letter and for considering taking part in the
      study.
      </p>

      <p>
      We look forward to hearing from you.
      </p>

      <p>
      Yours sincerely,
      </p>

      <p>

      PhD Student
